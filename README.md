# Signature-Verification-MLPC
This program uses MLPClassifier from scikit-learn to verify handwritten signatures. It preprocesses signature images by converting them to grayscale, resizing, and flattening them into feature vectors. The model is trained to distinguish between authentic and forged signatures, achieving classification based on extracted features.
